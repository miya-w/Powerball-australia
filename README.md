### How this work?

### How this help me to pick the number


### Will these calculated probabilities help me win the jackpot?

No, unfortunately not.

The Law of Large Numbers:
Using a coin as an example,
this fundamental principle of probability states that as the number of coin tosses increases, the proportion of heads and tails will approach 50-50. However, this does not mean that the exact number of heads and tails will always be equal.

A classic study by John Kerrich during World War II involved tossing a coin 10,000 times. The results showed that the ratio of heads to tails approached 50-50 over time, but deviations were always present at smaller intervals.

How Many Tosses to Reach 50-50?

Mathematically, there is no guarantee that the absolute counts of heads and tails will ever be perfectly equal. The probability of an exact tie decreases as the number of tosses increases due to the growing permutations of outcomes. However, the proportion (percentage) will get arbitrarily close to 50-50 as the number of tosses grows indefinitely.

While probability theory can explain long-term trends in randomness, it cannot predict specific outcomes in the short term. Each draw is an independent event, and the odds of winning the jackpot remain astronomically low.
